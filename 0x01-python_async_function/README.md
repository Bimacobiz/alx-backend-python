# 0x01. Python - Async

## Description

This repository contains exercises and examples related to asynchronous programming in Python using the asyncio library. Asynchronous programming allows you to write concurrent code that can perform multiple tasks concurrently, making efficient use of system resources and improving overall performance.

The exercises cover various concepts and techniques, including:

- Asynchronous functions and coroutines
- Event loops and tasks
- Concurrent execution with asyncio.gather and asyncio.wait
- Handling exceptions and errors in asynchronous code
- Synchronization primitives such as locks, semaphores, and queues
- Working with asynchronous I/O operations, including file I/O and network I/O
- Using third-party libraries and frameworks with asyncio, such as aiohttp for HTTP requests

Each exercise is accompanied by detailed explanations, code examples, and practical exercises to reinforce learning and understanding of asynchronous programming concepts in Python.

## Requirements

To run the exercises in this repository, you need:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- An understanding of basic Python programming concepts

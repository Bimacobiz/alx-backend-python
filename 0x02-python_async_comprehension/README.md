# Async Comprehension

## Description
This repository contains examples and explanations of async comprehension in Python.

## What is Async Comprehension?
Async comprehensions are a feature introduced in Python 3.6 that allows you to write comprehensions (list comprehensions, set comprehensions, and dictionary comprehensions) using the `async for` syntax. It's particularly useful when working with asynchronous iterators, such as those returned by asynchronous generators or objects implementing asynchronous iteration protocols.

## Contents
